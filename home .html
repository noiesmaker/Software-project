        spectacular temple festival held annually at the Vadakkunnathan Temple, featuring caparisoned elephants,
        traditional percussion music, and an awe-inspiring fireworks display. The Vadakkunnathan Temple itself is a
        prominent landmark and a UNESCO-recognized heritage site, showcasing classic Kerala-style architecture and
        ancient murals. Thrissur is also a hub of classical arts, being home to institutions like Kerala Kalamandalam,
        which nurtures performing arts such as Kathakali and Mohiniyattam. Economically, the city thrives as a major
